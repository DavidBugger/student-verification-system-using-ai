## Project Overview

This project utilizes Flask, OpenCV, and face_recognition library to create a web application that performs face recognition using your webcam. When a person's face is recognized, their name, gender, and criminal status (sample data) are displayed using a SweetAlert modal.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-flask.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd face-recognition-flask
    ```

3. Install the required packages using pip:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:

   Organize your dataset with images of known faces. Each person's images should be in a separate folder. Update `known_faces.json` with their information.

2. Start the Flask app:

   Run the app using the following command:

   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the app:

   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the webcam feed with face recognition and SweetAlert modals.
